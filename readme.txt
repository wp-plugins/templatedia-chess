Creates a new template in Templatedia for displaying chess moves.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new template to [Templatedia](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/templatedia/) (required for this plugin to work) that allows you to display a chess diagram in your posts or pages.

It is a replication of a [Wikipedia template](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Chess_diagram#Syntax) and accepts parameters in the exact same format.

This plugin was originally coded as an example for how to add a template to Templatedia via a plugin.
